=========================================
XVWA is a badly coded web application written in PHP/MySQL that helps security enthusiasts to learn application security.  It’s not advisable to host this application online as it is designed to be “Xtremely Vulnerable”. We recommend hosting this application in local/controlled environment and sharpening your application security ninja skills with any tools of your own choice. It’s totally legal to break or hack into this. The idea is to evangelize web application security to the community in possibly the easiest and fundamental way. Learn and acquire these skills for good purpose. How you use these skills and knowledge base is not our responsibility.
